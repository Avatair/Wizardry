      "Please, make no mistake; these are not the gentle, damsel-loving creatures of song and story. The tales I heard as a child about unicorns were keen to stress their beauty and intelligence, their kindness and faithfulness. Real unicorns are better described as 'stroppy'.",
      "These creatures are savage and territorial, sharp of horn and hard of hoof. As far as we can tell, they possess a burning desire to kick, stab or otherwise main any animal that crosses their path - wizards included - and will even resort to biting if in the mood. They seem to harbour a particular grudge against fairies, which they eat when possible.",
      "Some have argued that unicorns have little practical value, but their horns have potent magical properties. Also - as I've said elsewhere - fairies are remarkably annoying, so anything that keeps their numbers down can't be all bad."
