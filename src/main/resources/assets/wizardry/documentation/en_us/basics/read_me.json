        "Hello! Welcome to Wizardry! I'm glad you're reading this because as you should probably know, the mod is in alpha. Do note: EVERYTHING can change DRASTICALLY. Please withhold from forming an opinion about the mod until a beta is out. Thank you.\nThis book is INCOMPLETE and therefore does not contain all the information required to start with the mod, so here's what you need to know:\nFirst of all, PLEASE read the other sections of the book (fun reads, believe me), then come back here.\nGood. Now that you know what mana is, what capes are, and how nacre pearls work, we can start.",
        "How to craft some stuff:\n- Devil dust = throw redstone into fire and wait.\n- Mana battery =  throw soul sand, a diamond, and devil dust into the center of a 3x3 of liquid mana then wait.\n- mana orb = throw a glass orb into liquid mana\n- liquid nacre = throw a gold nugget into liquid mana, then wait.\n- nacre pearl = throw a mana orb into liquid nacre\n- wisdom wood anything = throw regular wood blocks into liquid mana, they’ll convert",
        "To begin making spells, you need to build 2 structures, a mana battery and a crafting altar. You can view the structures in the following pages along with a material list for each.\n[structure:mana_battery]\n[structure:crafting_plate]",
        "To help you build the structures, hold a magic wand in your hand and it will render the structure in the world for you around the center block (mana battery or crafting plate).\nOnce you place a pearl holder on one of the dots, right click the pearl holder with a mana orb to put it in. The battery will promptly suck the mana out of the orb passively. You may want more mana orbs to fill it up fast.",
        "The crafting plate will automatically find the nearest mana battery to suck mana from in a 64 block range (configurable).\nNow that you have both structures, you’re now eligible to make spells.",
        "To make a spell, craft a magician’s worktable and right click it. In the sidebars, you can see spell components that you can drag and drop to the piece of paper in the center. For example: drag a self shape component which targets the caster (you), then a drag a leap effect component.\nTo link the two so the spell goes (respectively) “Cast a spell on myself, this spell is going to leap me”, hold down right click and drag from the placed “self” component and drop to your “leap” component, you should see a connection line while you drag and a finalized-link between the two after you drop.\nThis is a complete spell. It will leap the caster. Now hit the “Save” button (WITH THIS GUIDE IN YOUR INVENTORY). The spell will save TO THIS BOOK under a new tab called `Spell recipe`",
        "If you open the book, you can read what items you must drop onto the crafting plate IN ORDER in the crafting plate.\nOnce you drop the items, drop a nacre pearl in to finalize it and infuse the pearl with the spell. You should see it animate and then explode. Take the pearl out after exploding and crafting it with a staff. You can now right click the staff to launch yourself in the air.\nIf the items hover in the center of the crafting plate, it means there is no mana feeding into the plate. Add more mana orbs into the mana battery to fill it up more.",
        "To cast more powerful or more complex spells, craft a cape and wear it. You MUST passively wear the cape to increase its powers as mentioned in the cape section. More time = more power. Some debug information is available in its tooltip.",
        "ENJOY!"
