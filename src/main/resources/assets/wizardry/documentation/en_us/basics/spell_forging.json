        "No wizard would be complete without their arsenal of magic. And the ways we use, unlike many, give you much finer control over the patterns in your spells.",
        "Using the Worktable, you can etch a spell's pattern. The powers you can access are listed off to the left side of the paper on the table. You can slide these powers to the paper, and connect them to create the effect. A simple spell, for example, would be the “self” focus, and the “leap” power. Then, hold down the focus, and slide the line it will produce to leap. Using these symbols, and modifiers placed on the symbols, the world of power that wizards access will open up. You only have to be smart enough to use it... and so I'd recommend you to stick to the basics. This book has the ability to lift these spells from the pages of the worktable, and turn them into reagent patterns. Once you've saved the spell to your book, you can read what is required by opening the Codex.",
        "Now, this step might be too hard for a little one like you, but I feel that following my instructions, you'll manage. You'll need to take the items listed in the Codex, and place them, one by one, into the Crafter's Plate. A hard task, I know, and I'm not sure someone of your caliber can live up. The final ingredient is, always, a Nacre pearl. The Wisdom of the pearl allows it to hold the spell, creating a pearl able to channel the magic. The closer the pearl is to its Apex, the stronger the resulting spell will be.",
        "Once you've supplied enough raw power, raw mana, to the altar, the pearl is complete. And then, you've taken your first step into our domain. Welcome to the fold."
