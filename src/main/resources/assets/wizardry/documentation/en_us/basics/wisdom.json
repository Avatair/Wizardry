        "The presence of raw mana provides a wonderful environment for certain things to grow. Life forms immune to overloading on mana, from years of evolution with exposure. Through years of breeding, these trees lie latent in common forests as well. The name we wizards have given to these mana-sucking trees is “wisdom wood”, named after what every student of mine lacks.",
        "Activating the Wisdom in trees is simple. Throwing the wood into mana will awaken the power lying within. Mind you, this doesn't work for humans. A problem like yours is far more dire than any tree's stupidity.",
        "These latent forms of Wisdom have one more form, in gold. By tainting mana liquid with small balls of gold, known colloquially as Nuggets, fit for dissolving, the mana turns into a beautiful milky solution, named Nacre for its similarity to the resplendent mother-of-pearl. This substance, while not as powerful as the raw mana it's made from, opens up very interesting possibilities in magic.",
        "Redstone's personal Wisdom is a bit easier to access. Much like a student, you have to hew off the gunk and mundane stupidity from the outside to find the power within. By using fire to melt off the impurities, and fuse together the fine grains, you can get a good student -- or rather, devil dust. The first one is impossible. Devil dust, too, has interesting applications in manipulating mana."
