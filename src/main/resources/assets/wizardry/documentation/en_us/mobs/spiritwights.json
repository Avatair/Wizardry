        "Little is known about these creatures. Those few unfortunate enough to have any interaction with them rarely survive the experience; as a result, the few observations that survive are more to do with how quickly they can disassemble the average wizard than with their patterns or behaviours. As a result, the only real advice for dealing with them is this: if you see one, run. And don’t stop.",
        "It is possible to fight a spiritwight. It is even theoretically possible to win, in the same way that it is theoretically possible to win a fist fight with a dragon. Strong potions of harming have proven to have some effect on them, in so far as these things can be measured, and it is possible that a wizard of exceptional power and skill may be able to craft weapons and armour strong enough to successfully oppose them. If this is you, do make sure to tell people; they probably won’t believe you, but at least someone will know.",
        "If you decline to fight them – which, let’s be honest, is the only sensible choice – then do not be deceived by their sluggishness. Spiritwights are slow, lumbering things, but this belies their relentless nature. Once a spiritwight has caught the scent of a wizard, they will hunt them almost to the ends of the earth. When you run from them, keep looking over your shoulder. and don’t ever stop for long. They certainly won’t.",
        "It is one final point of interest that spiritwights reserve their hatred for wizards. As far as we know, they show no interest in any other creature. A unicorn may go where a wizard fears to tread, and face no danger. There must be some reason for this, but who knows it?"
