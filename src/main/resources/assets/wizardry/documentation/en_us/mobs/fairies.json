        "The most important attribute of what we call â€˜fairies' -- and by far the first thing that most young wizards notice -- is that they are extremely annoying. Although they actually appear to be some kind of by-product of mana usage and have nothing resembling sentience, they have a remarkable knack for being in exactly the wrong place at the wrong time. Any time a wizard attempts some great feat of concentration anywhere near fairies, it is almost guaranteed that the little blighters will do their utmost to distract the magical process.",
        "Like unicorns, however, they are not entirely useless: if you can catch one and squeeze it into a jar, it provides a magnificent light source. Also, you can use them to make excellent jam."
