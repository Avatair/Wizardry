0.41
Fix crash when loaded on a server.
Fixed bug with version checker and added link + changelog formatting
Animated the book's bookmarks and redid their math completely
Added a material list to the book's structures

0.4.1
The mana battery and crafting altar have been redone and simplified! You will need to rebuild your structures.
The book renders structures now but doesn't display materials yet, sorry.
For convenience: You can right-click your spell-bound book (codex) directly onto a crafting plate to instantly create a spell pearl in creative mode.
The worktable now animates!
To add modifiers to modules in the worktables, you can now `select` a module by clicking it (on the paper).
Sorry for the delay. Have fun!
